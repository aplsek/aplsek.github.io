  abstract = {Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) is becoming
a popular choice in the world of real-time programming.
However, the complexities introduced by RTSJ bring
needs for an extensive framework comprising all the aspects
of RTSJ development. As the first contribution of this
paper we present a real-time component model directly fitting
the needs of RTSJ. Our motivation is to clearly separate
real-time and business concerns of applications. We
further argue that RTSJ concerns need to be considered at
early stages of architecture design in order to mitigate the
complexities of the implementation phase. Therefore, as our
second contribution, we propose a design process introducing
gradually RTSJ concepts into the architecture. We are
thus able to alleviate the development of real-time systems
and to tailor them for different real-time conditions. Finally,
we demonstrate the feasibility of our solution on an example
scenario.}
