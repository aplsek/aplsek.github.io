  abstract = {Ambient-Oriented Programming (AmOP) comprises a suite of challenges
that are hard to meet by current software development techniques.
Although Component-Oriented Programming (COP) represents promising
approach, the state-of-the-art component models do not provide
sufficient adaptability towards specific constraints of the Ambient
field. In this position paper we argue that merging AmOP and COP can
be achieved by introducing the Fractal component model and its new
feature : Component-Based Controlling Membranes. The proposed
solution allows dynamical adaptation of component systems towards
the challenges of the Ambient world.}
